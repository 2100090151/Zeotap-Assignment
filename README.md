# Zeotap Assignment: EDA, Lookalike Model, and Customer Segmentation

This repository contains my solutions for the **Zeotap Assignment**, which involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, building a **Lookalike Model**, and conducting **Customer Segmentation** based on customer, product, and transaction data.

## Tasks and Deliverables

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Goal**: Analyze the provided datasets (Customers, Products, Transactions) to derive business insights.
- **Approach**: Performed data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization to uncover key patterns.
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Distribution of customers across different regions.
  - Popular product categories and pricing trends.
  - Insights into purchase behaviors and seasonal patterns.

**Deliverables**:
- `FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with EDA code.
- `FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf` – PDF report with business insights.

### 2. Lookalike Model
- **Goal**: Build a model to recommend similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
- **Approach**: Combined customer and transaction features to calculate similarity scores using **Cosine Similarity**.
- **Results**: For the first 20 customers, the model identifies the top 3 most similar customers with their respective similarity scores.

**Deliverables**:
- `FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv` – CSV with lookalike recommendations.
- `FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with the model development.

### 3. Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- **Goal**: Segment customers into distinct groups based on their profiles and transaction behaviors.
- **Approach**: Used **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers and calculated clustering metrics such as the **Davies-Bouldin Index**.
- **Results**: Generated a segmentation of customers into [X] clusters with visualizations.

**Deliverables**:
- `FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with clustering code.
- `FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf` – PDF report with clustering results and evaluation metrics.

## Repository Structure

- **/EDA**: EDA code and analysis results.
- **/Lookalike**: Lookalike model implementation and recommendation output.
- **/Clustering**: Customer segmentation/clustering code and report.
